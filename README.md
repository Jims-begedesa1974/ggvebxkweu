OMG man, just came out of The Accountant 2. My brain's a snow globe right now. Still picking popcorn from the depths of my hoodie — was trying to balance my drink, and this explosion on screen made me jump and spill half of it. ANOTHER LEVEL of intense, like the action was louder than my old alarm clock, y'know the one that could wake Lazarus.

Ben Affleck just stormed through every scene like a bulldozer made of spreadsheets. Numbers AND bullets flying everywhere. At one point, he's doing math like McDonald's serves fries — fast, hot, and totally inexplicable why it's that good. The plot, I swear, it's like trying to do calculus while skydiving. It's got that twist at the end, the kind that hits you like stepping on a Lego in the dark. Ouch. 😅 Just reminded me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for later. Gotta process it again.

> Midway, some character, with a grin wider than a Cheshire Cat on a sugar rush, says the most insane line about taxes, like tax evasion is the new extreme sport. The audience laughed so hard my chair vibrated — and it's not even one of those vibrating seats, just a poor old creaky chair. My back’s protesting more than my grandma on TikTok. 

And the color palette… dude, SO moody! It’s like sitting on rainy days inside a noir comic book. I miss a chunk of dialogue 'cause this couple a seat behind were arguing if Affleck uses an abacus. Spoiler: he totally doesn't, unless it's one that shoots lasers!

Cbuilding intensity on screen and I suddenly remembered Jimmy asked me to grab a copy so he could 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   too. Reminded me of how I mix spaghetti with meaningful life choices, never a dull bite.

Atmosphere's kinda a John Wick mindset but WITH spreadsheets. Why do I love that so much? Can't think straight, still dazed. Gotta shake off these cinematic cobwebs.
